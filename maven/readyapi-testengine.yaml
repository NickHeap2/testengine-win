  # Edit the allowedConnectTargets property to control what hosts the ReadyAPI TestEngine can connect to.
  # The property accepts a list (may contain just one element) of strings in the format accepted
  # by java.net.SocketPermission - see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/SocketPermission.html.
  # Use a broadcast address (an IP address ending in 0) to allow connections to a whole subnet (see the last example
  # below).
  # The default wildcard will allow connections to all hosts and all ports.
  # Some examples of valid strings:
  #   allowedConnectTargets:
  #     - *:8080
  #     - www.google.com:443
  #     - sunet.se:80-

  # For instance, setting the property to
  #   allowedFilePaths:
  #     - /shared
  #     - /workgroupfiles
  # will allow users to post a project which will use the
  # input file /shared/data.csv in a data source and write data to the file /workgroupfiles/data_sink.xls using a
  # data sink test step.
